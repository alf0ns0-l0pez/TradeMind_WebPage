            <h3>ðŸª™ About Bitcoin Halving</h3>
            <p>
                The halving event is automatically triggered by the Bitcoin network once 210,000 blocks have been
                mined since the last halving. This count is embedded within the Bitcoin protocol and can not be
                changed without forking the Bitcoin blockchain and creating a new cryptocurrency.
                <br />
                The next Bitcoin halving is expected on April 20, 2024 after block 740,000 has been mined. It will
                reduce the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.
                <br />
                Bitcoin halving directly impacts its supply by reducing the rate at which new coins are generated,
                creating a scarcity effect. This scarcity can lead to increased demand if Bitcoin's adoption and
                investor interest continue to grow.
